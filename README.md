# COUNTER-Robots
Official list of user agents that are regarded as robots/spiders by COUNTER

## Purpose of this list
The growing use of web crawler robots have the potential to inflate usage statistics. Only genuine, user-driven usage should be reported in usage statistics. This list can be used to determine whether a request is performed by a bot or if it is performed by a genuine user.

## Pull requests
This list is open for extension and anyone can make a new pull request with new additions to this list. When proposing new bots it is important to give an explanation/argumentation on why you think that is a bot.

## Versioning
Every new release will be tagged with a specific month and year. Versions and changes can be viewed in CHANGES.md

## Format of the list - Considerations for the future
The list is just a simple text file with one bot per line. These bots can contain regular expressions and should be matched accordingly. We should think if this is an optimal format for the future and can eventually consider changing to another format (or keeping an additional second format).
